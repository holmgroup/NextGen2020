Last update: June 4, 2020

This repository serves the 2020 NextGen Fellows at Carnegie Mellon University under Prof. Elizabeth Holm.

We'll push new notebooks to this repository prior to our discussions (kind of like a Canvas page). Feel free to clone this repository and pull when we send word of updates.

The discussions are currently scheduled:

|  Day |Topic   |Goals   |Instructor   |

| Monday, June 8, 2020  |Set up Jupyter notebooks: <br>Acquire steel defects data |-Display images by class<br>-Data structured for subsequent analyses |Andrew|
|Tuesday, June 9, 2020|Traditional image representation:<br>Represent images as brightness histograms   |-Compute and store brightness histograms for all images<br>-Compute average brightness histogram for each class and show they are different|Nan|
|Wednesday, June 10, 2020|CNN image representation:<br>Represent images using CNN layers<br>Reduce dimensionality using PCA|-Compute and store representations of all images based on two layers of pre-trained VGG16: FCL and shallow layer |Bo|
|Thursday, June 11, 2020|Unsupervised learning: k-means and t-SNE Cluster each representation|-k-means and t-SNE plots for each representation, color coded by ground truth<br>-Compare representations and clustering methods|Ryan|
|Friday, June 12, 2020| Supervised learning: SVM<br>Train and evaluate SVM|-Classification performance (confusion matrices) for each representation| Andrew|
