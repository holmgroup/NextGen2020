# NextGen Fellows 2021 Repository
Last update: June 7, 2021

This repository serves the 2021 NextGen Fellows at Carnegie Mellon University under Prof. Elizabeth Holm.

We'll push new notebooks to this repository prior to our discussions (kind of like a Canvas page). Feel free to clone this repository and pull when we send word of updates.

Seminars for the first week are scheduled where we'll cover some basic concepts to bring you up to speed with some ideas and methods that we'll explore in this program.

|  Day |Topic   |Resources   |Instructor   |
|---|---|---|---|
|Monday, June 7, 2021  |Introduction: <br>NextGen Program <br>CV/ML for microstructure | Overview paper <br>Set of group papers | Liz| 
|Tuesday, June 8, 2021 |Data featurizing and dimensionality reduction by PCA |Class notes | Srujana |
|Wednesday, June 9, 2021 |Image representation using CNNs |Slides <br>Web resources | Bo |
|Thursday, June 10, 2021 |Clustering by k-Means and t-SNE |Class notes | Ryan |

We will also go over some hands-on tutorials to help you practice new skills. These are just a start; we're excited to see where you take your research project!
